* New release notes go here.

2.0.2 (2017-02-06)
------------------

* Fix when the check for ``CORS_MODEL`` is done to allow it to properly add
  the headers and respond to ``OPTIONS`` requests.

2.0.1 (2017-01-29)
------------------

* Add support for specifying 'null' in ``CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST``.

2.0.0 (2017-01-07)
------------------

* Remove previously undocumented ``CorsModel`` as it was causing migration
  issues. For backwards compatibility, any users previously using ``CorsModel``
  should create a model in their own app that inherits from the new
  ``AbstractCorsModel``, and to keep using the same data, set the model's
  ``db_table`` to 'corsheaders_corsmodel'. Users not using ``CorsModel``
  will find they have an unused table that they can drop.
* Make sure that ``Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`` is in the response if the
  client asks for it.

1.3.1 (2016-11-09)
------------------

* Fix a bug with the single check if CORS enabled added in 1.3.0: on Django
  < 1.10 shortcut responses could be generated by middleware above
  ``CorsMiddleware``, before it processed the request, failing with an
  ``AttributeError`` for ``request._cors_enabled``. Also clarified the docs
  that ``CorsMiddleware`` should be kept as high as possible in your middleware
  stack, above any middleware that can generate such responses.

1.3.0 (2016-11-06)
------------------

* Add checks to validate the types of the settings.
* Add the 'Do Not Track' header ``'DNT'`` to the default for
  ``CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS``.
* Add 'Origin' to the 'Vary' header of outgoing requests when not allowing all
  origins, as per the CORS spec. Note this changes the way HTTP caching works
  with your CORS-enabled responses.
* Check whether CORS should be enabled on a request only once. This has had a
  minor change on the conditions where any custom signals will be called -
  signals will now always be called *before* ``HTTP_REFERER`` gets replaced,
  whereas before they could be called before and after. Also this attaches the
  attribute ``_cors_enabled`` to ``request`` - please take care that other
  code you're running does not remove it.

1.2.2 (2016-10-05)
------------------

* Add ``CorsModel.__str__`` for human-readable text
* Add a signal that allows you to add code for more intricate control over when
  CORS headers are added.

1.2.1 (2016-09-30)
------------------

* Made settings dynamically respond to changes, and which allows you to import
  the defaults for headers and methods in order to extend them.

1.2.0 (2016-09-28)
------------------

* Drop Python 2.6 support.
* Drop Django 1.3-1.7 support, as they are no longer supported.
* Confirmed Django 1.9 support (no changes outside of tests were necessary).
* Added Django 1.10 support.
* Package as a universal wheel.

1.1.0 (2014-12-15)
------------------

* django-cors-header now supports Django 1.8 with its new application loading
  system! Thanks @jpadilla for making this possible and sorry for the delay in
  making a release.

1.0.0 (2014-12-13)

django-cors-headers is all grown-up :) Since it's been used in production for
many many deployments, I think it's time we mark this as a stable release.
